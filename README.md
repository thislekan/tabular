#### Things to note

- The styling and general look of the UI is bare.
- the focus was on functionality
- all features were implemented (some are buggy)

#### List of features

- [x] Should display all fetched APIs with their properties
- [x] Should allow users to expand the row when they click on it and see extra content
- [x] Should allow users to modify the description
- [x] Should allow users to sort the rows by name
- [x] Should allow users to filter/search by keyword
- [x] Should allow users to delete a record
- [x] Add pagination
- [x] Create a tab and add additional tables in other tabs
- [x] Add the ability to undo changes
- [x] Add the ability to redo changes

#### What can be improved?

- undo & redo features (it has some bugs)
- the UI (currently, it's skeletal)
- tests (none written)
- cleanup (some components, DRY & KISS principles could be implemented)
- page limit (not smooth enough experience)
- implement debounce for some input fields
